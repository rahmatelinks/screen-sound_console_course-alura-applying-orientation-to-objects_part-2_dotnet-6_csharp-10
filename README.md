## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for learners who want to master Object-Oriented Programming in C#. It provides hands-on exercises that reinforce the concepts taught in the course. By engaging with these exercises, you will build a solid foundation in OOP principles, which are essential for any software developer.

## Course Overview

The course covers various aspects of C# and OOP, including:

- **Class Creation**: Learn how to create and structure classes in C#.
- **Encapsulation**: Understand how to use properties to protect class data.
- **Object Integration**: Explore how different objects can interact with each other.
- **Constructors**: Discover how to initialize objects properly.
- **Practical Challenges**: Solve real-world problems to apply what you learn.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes exercises and materials related to the following topics:

- **Alura**
- **Classes**
- **Console**
- **Constructors**
- **C#**
- **.NET**
- **Encapsulation**
- **OOP**
- **POO**
- **Properties**

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow the steps outlined in the **Installation** section below. You will need to have .NET 6 and C# 10 installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmatelinks/screen-sound_console_course-alura-applying-orientation-to-objects_part-2_dotnet-6_csharp-10.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd screen-sound_console_course-alura-applying-orientation-to-objects_part-2_dotnet-6_csharp-10
   ```

3. **Restore Dependencies**: If you are using any external libraries, make sure to restore them:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Build the Project**: Compile the project using:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the Application**: Start the application with:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

You can find additional files and executables in the [Releases section](https://github.com/rahmatelinks/screen-sound_console_course-alura-applying-orientation-to-objects_part-2_dotnet-6_csharp-10/releases).

## Usage

Once you have successfully installed and run the application, you can start working on the exercises. Each exercise focuses on a specific OOP concept. 

1. **Explore Classes**: Start by creating your own classes. Think about the properties and methods that each class should have.
   
2. **Implement Encapsulation**: Use properties to control access to class data. Ensure that your data is protected from unintended changes.

3. **Work with Constructors**: Create constructors that initialize your objects correctly. Experiment with different constructor overloads.

4. **Integrate Objects**: Create multiple objects and have them interact with each other. This will help you understand how objects can work together.

5. **Solve Practical Challenges**: Engage with the challenges provided in the repository. These will test your understanding and application of the concepts learned.
